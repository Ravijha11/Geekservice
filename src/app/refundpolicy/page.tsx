        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8 font-serif">Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-serif">Welcome to "Geek Services" Refund Policy. For subscription-based plans, a full refund will be issued if Geek Services has not been able to resolve even a single issue for you within the first 30 days of the subscription. If there are one or more resolved issues, the fees for the Subscription Service will not be refundable. Notwithstanding this Geek Services, at its sole discretion and on a case-by-case basis, agree to a refund of Subscription fees after deducting charges for servicing the Customer.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 font-serif">For incident-based plans, you will be eligible for refund when any of the following criterions are met:</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-lg font-serif">
          <li>You have all the prerequisites which were required to resolve the problem</li>
          <li>Issue was not resolved until the time account was active</li>
          <li>30 days have not passed after the issue was last worked upon by a Geek Services Technology technician</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 font-serif">Service Plans</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-serif">You may order Services by submitting Plan Orders through the Geek Services Websites or by calling Geek Services. Once Geek Services accepts the Plan Order submitted by you, then you will receive an email from Geek Services at the email address that you provide or have provided to Geek Services as part of the Registration Process for the Services. Geek Services is not responsible for rendering Services in connection with any Plan Order that it has not accepted. Upon acceptance by Geek Services of a Plan Order, you will have a Service Plan.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 font-serif">Undertaking</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-serif">Subject to the Terms and Conditions, and other terms specific to each Service Plan, Geek Services will address your query using commercially reasonable efforts in providing appropriate solutions under the Services. In most cases, Geek Services will attempt problem diagnosis and a solution through chat, email or other means as it deems most appropriate under the circumstances including remote access. You understand that if remote access is used on your computer there will be no residual software from the remote session; however, there may be a text file placed on your computer that will explain the work that was done on your computer. If such a text file is placed on your computer, you have the option to either save the file for future reference or to delete it from your computer. All undertakings under Service Plans are subject to Geek Services's Limited Warranty, which is set forth below. You agree to pay all Services Fee and any other applicable fee/charges as set out in the relevant Plan Order in accordance with the Payment Terms provided below.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 font-serif">Payment</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-serif">Services against any Plan Order will be available once you have made payment for Services according to the requirements of the corresponding Plan Order. Geek Services has no obligation to render Services under any Service Plan if the payments as required under any Plan Order have not been made. You understand that certain Service Plans may have fee including, but not limited to "Service Fee" and/or "Activation Fee" payable either on an annual basis ("Annual Payment Plan") or on a monthly basis ("Recurring Payment Plan"). Subject to the applicable Term Plan, all payments under the Annual Plan shall be made upfront at time of commencement of the subscription cycle.</p>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-serif">For payments under the Recurring Payment Plan, apart from the monthly installments of the Service Fee, payable over a one (1) year payment term, you may be charged an additional non-refundable Activation Fee at the time of registration, as specified in the Plan Order. The fee (including Activation Fee) will not be refunded in case of cancellation of the Service Plan unless otherwise stated in the Plan Order.</p>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-serif">All fee under this clause or a relevant Plan Order, is payable at the time of commencement of the Service Plan. When you purchased the Service, you agreed to a specific price and plan, where such plan maybe for a term of one, two or three years ("Term Plan"). All terms of Service Fee and/or any other fee payable under any mode of payment for a Subscription shall be set forth in the applicable Plan Order. Similarly, some plans may offer a discount on the Service if you sign up for other Geek Services services ("Bundle Discount"). You agree to maintain your Service and the bundled services for the applicable term. If you signed up for a Term Plan or a Bundle Discount,the price available with those plans is valid until one of the following occurs:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-lg font-serif">
          <li>The Term Plan expires</li>
          <li>You drop one of the Geek Services services you were required to purchase to receive the special rate as notified to Geek Services</li>
          <li>You terminate the agreement/Service Plan before the expiry of the relevant term.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 font-serif">Credit Card Billing</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-serif">You may be asked to provide us with a credit card number from a card issuer that we accept in order to activate your Service. You hereby authorize Geek Services to charge and/or place a hold on your credit card with respect to any unpaid charges for Services or any related equipment. You authorize the issuer of the credit card to pay any amounts described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that these charges are to be accepted as authorization to the issuer of the credit card to pay any amounts described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that these charges are to be accepted as authorization to the issuer of the credit card to pay all such amounts.
